# 📊 Data Folder

This folder stores your application data and settings. Files here are automatically generated and managed by the Swipe application.

## 📁 **Auto-Generated Files:**

- **`customization_settings.json`** - Your job description and custom instructions
- **`decisions.json`** - Your swipe decisions (saved, passed, starred candidates)
- **`decision_history.json`** - Complete history of all your review actions
- **`summaries_cache.json`** - AI-generated candidate analysis cache

## 🔒 **Privacy Note:**
All files in this folder are automatically excluded from version control. Your hiring decisions and candidate analyses stay private on your local machine.

## ⚠️ **Important:**
- **Don't manually edit these files** - they're managed by the application
- **Don't delete this folder** - the app needs it to save your progress
- **Backing up:** You can copy these files to backup your review progress

## 🔄 **Reset Application:**
To start fresh, you can delete the files in this folder (but keep the folder itself). The application will regenerate them as needed.
